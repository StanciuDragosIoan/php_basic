-created a core directory (added database folder + bootstrap file to it);
-created a 'contact us' view and an 'about us' view and added them to a views folder together with the index.view.php;
-created a controllers directory;
-created an index.file in the controllers, and added the folowing lines to it:

		
    $tasks = $query->selectAll('todos');
    require 'index.view.php';
	
    #now the main inex.php in the root only loads the bootstrap.php file;

-inside the 'controllers' directory, created an about.php, about-culture.php, contact.php (3 controllers) + created the view for 
about-culture;

-created a 'routes.php' file and added the routes as array in there;
	#instead of an array, made the routes to come from the method of an obj:


	$router-> define([

    		'' => 'controllers.index.php',

    		'about' => 'controllers/about.php',

    		'about/culture' => 'controllers/about-culture.php',

    		'contact' => 'controllers/contact.php'
	]);

-created a Router.php class inside the 'core' directory;
-required the Router class in the bootstrap.php + adjusted paths to other requires in there;

-created a private property (routes = [];) inside the Router class, and a define() method for the routes;
